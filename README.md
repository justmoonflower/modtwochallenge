I created a web page to use as my portfolio to display future projects, and present to employers when it has been modified and completed.

I started by creating my repository within git hub, then pulling that to save onto my computer using GitBash. The push/pull method was used frequently throughout creating my web page to upload and comment on saved work within my respoitory. 

Adding a css file, I was able to start designing the layout for my portfolio. 

On the HTML file, I mapped out the body elements to include main and footer sections, each having section classes within. With these section classes and IDs, I was able to start building my CSS file by identifying the class name. Using flex properties, margin, border, padding, color, size and other design options, I crafted my portfolio. 

Images on the webpage were added by entering links into the HTML file. This was also used to link my Module One Project as a deployed application when clicked. 

*MODULE ONE PROJECT WAS ADDED WITH IMAGES AND CODE SOURCE FROM EDUCATIONAL ASSIGNMENT THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND*

With developer tools, I was able to test the responsiveness of my portfolio while creating it.
